# House Prices Challenge

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model to analyze and predict housing prices in a small neighborhood in Ames Iowa. The challenge can be found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques), and a linear regression model was used to interpret the most important factors that affect housing prices.
