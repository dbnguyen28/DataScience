# TTC: Understanding How Delays Work

The goal of this project was to understand the causes behind TTC delays and to build a predictive model that is able to accurately predict whether or not a delay would happen.

The problem was tackled by visualizing patterns in the delays and modeling was performed using logistic regression, random forest, and knn. Performance was measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score
