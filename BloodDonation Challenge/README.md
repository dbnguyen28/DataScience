# Predicting Blood Donations

The purpose of this competition was to predict whether or not a person would donate blood based on their past donations. Data was collected from a mobile blood donation vehicle in Taiwan in 2007.

Performance of predictive models were measured using log loss and data can be found on https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/2/warm-up-predict-blood-donations/page/5/
